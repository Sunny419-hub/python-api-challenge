# python-api-challenge
Part I - WeatherPy
In this challenge, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
Part II - VacationPy
Using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API, I worked with weather data in order to plan future vacations.
